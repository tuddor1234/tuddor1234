Do you work with real-time 3D data and need it to actually behave the way the real world does?
Are you trying to simulate complex environments, stream behavior across devices, or build immersive XR experiences with high performance and low latency?

I specialize in real-time data streaming and 3D simulation tools, helping teams connect the digital and physical worlds with precision and speed. Whether you’re prototyping an interactive system, visualizing sensor data in 3D, or building next-gen remote collaboration workflows, I help you bridge the gap between your code and the real world.

Here's how I can help:
𝗖++ / 𝗖# / Real-Time Systems
• Low-level protocol integrations (telemetry, remote rendering, live device feeds)
• Cross-platform streaming architecture (custom engines, Unity, Unreal)
• Fast, responsive API development for real-time data processing
• Client-server architecture using WebSockets, MQTT, REST for XR/IoT

3D Simulation + Data Integration
• High-performance pipelines for tracking, gesture recognition, face/body data
• Real-time visualization tools (WPF, ImGUI, Qt)
• Plugins and SDKs that extend or connect 3D engines to real-world inputs
• Edge/cloud streaming (Azure, Firebase) for collaborative XR workflows

UX + Control Systems
 • Interfaces and dashboards for spatial data control, editing, and review
 • Remote control of apps/devices, including mobile endpoints and iOS connectivity

If you’re building something where timing, data accuracy, and immersive interactivity are critical, let’s talk.

I don't just build tools, I connect systems. From sensor to screen. From data to experience.
